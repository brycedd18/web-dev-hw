# Assignment 2
# Bryce DeWitt

I took this class because I am interested in coding I've been doing basic web design for a little while but I was ready to take it to the next level.

-One thing I've learned is how to use the application Atom in correlation with Github.

-I want to learn how to make a fully functional website in HTML that is clean and professional.

-Finally I hope to get a better understanding of CSS and its integration with HTML
