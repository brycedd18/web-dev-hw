Each document has only one head and one body element. Everything placed in the head is not shown on the actual webpage seen by people. This includes meta tags and the title of the site. The body is what the page visitors actually see. This is where all paragraphs and images and hyperlinks will go. Documents can only have two of these in order to keep things organized and for the page to run smoothly.

The structural markup is for things like heading and in general just the "structure" portion of the webpage. The semantic has more to do with the content of the webpages. This is for when you want certain things to be bold, for example.

To prepare for this assignment I found a recipe for the project and then proceeded to save images and create a new folder for the assignment. With the new information I learned about html I was able to format the document in a concise and understandable way.
