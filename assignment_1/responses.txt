1. Knowing the differences between the web and the internet is a good start when taking a deep dive into the world of computers. The interent is a network where computers are able to communicate with eachother from all around the world. The world wide web, on the other hand, creates a user interface for people that makes accessing files spread across devices from the internet much easier to use and understand. In short the internet provides all the data while the web gives users the tools to take this data and understand it.

2. The internet is a complicated system consisting of networks withing more networks. Data is sent and recieved across large wires all around the world that is broken down into smaller pieces that all meet in the same place again to create a whole file. When people use their wifi it first comes from a hardwired source that then goes to a router that pushes out a wireless signal that is picked up by certain devices that can recieve and send data wirelessly without the need for a hard connection to the internet access. 

3. A directory can be thought of as the parent of a file. What a directory does is hold files and other folders. Without the directory files would be cluttered and there would be no sense of organization. The files would simply be lost in the digital landscape.

4. The benefits of VCS are pretty astounding. This allows github users to see every change they've made to a repo as well as go back to previous versions if something isn't working quite right with a new change. It also makes collaborations that much easier by showing them what you have added and or taken away. This is also good from a student perspective as it allows us to see our mistakes clearly in order to learn from them in the future.

5. Everything in this section involving github was very new for me so I would say that is the most exciting. Learning how to use repositories and the other tools offered by this site have been mildly challenging but fun overall.
